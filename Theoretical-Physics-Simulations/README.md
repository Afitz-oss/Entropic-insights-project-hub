## üî¨ Physics Background

### Special Relativity
These simulations demonstrate key concepts from Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity:

- **Time Dilation**: Moving clocks run slower relative to stationary observers
- **Lorentz Factor**: Œ≥ = 1/‚àö(1 - v¬≤/c¬≤)
- **Twin Paradox**: The traveling twin ages less due to time dilation
- **Velocity Addition**: How velocities combine in relativistic scenarios

### General Relativity
The spacetime visualizer shows concepts from General Relativity:

- **Spacetime Curvature**: Mass curves the fabric of spacetime
- **Einstein Field Equations**: GŒºŒΩ = 8œÄTŒºŒΩ
- **Gravitational Effects**: Objects follow curved spacetime paths
- **Tidal Forces**: Differential gravitational effects

## üìö Educational Use

These simulations are perfect for:
- **Physics Education** - Visual demonstration of abstract concepts
- **University Courses** - Interactive supplements to relativity lectures  
- **Science Museums** - Engaging public demonstrations
- **Research Presentations** - Professional-quality visualizations
- **Self-Study** - Exploration of relativistic effects

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After using these simulations, users will understand:
- How velocity affects the passage of time
- Why the Twin Paradox occurs and its resolution
- The relationship between mass and spacetime curvature
- Real-world applications of relativistic effects
- The mathematical foundations of Einstein's theories

## üîß Customization

### Time Dilation Simulation
- Modify `SPEED_OF_LIGHT`, `WINDOW_WIDTH`, `WINDOW_HEIGHT` for different scales
- Adjust `max_distance` and `turnaround_time` for journey parameters
- Customize colors and fonts for different visual themes

### Analysis Toolkit
- Change velocity ranges in plotting functions
- Add custom real-world examples in `plot_real_world_examples()`
- Modify animation parameters for different frame rates

### General Relativity Visualizer
- Adjust `masses` and `positions` for different celestial configurations
- Modify `grid_resolution` for performance vs. quality trade-offs
- Customize visual modes by editing `create_enhanced_stars()`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **ImportError**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Performance Issues**: Reduce grid resolution in the GR visualizer (press 'G')
- **Animation Problems**: Update matplotlib and ensure proper graphics drivers
- **Font Issues**: Default fonts should work on all systems, but you can modify font paths if needed
