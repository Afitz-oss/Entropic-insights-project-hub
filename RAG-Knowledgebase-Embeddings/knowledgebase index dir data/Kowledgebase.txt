Tactical Event Report

Summary:

On May 9th, 2023, there were a total of 7 events reported in Donetsk. Russian missile attacks caused damage to regional water and energy infrastructure, as well as an industrial enterprise in Kramatorsk. The Siversky-Donets canal remains largely under Ukrainian control but has been frequently contested along its long route, causing water shortages to become an increasingly critical problem for the Russian occupiers in the temporarily uncontrolled Donetsk. Fortunately, there were no casualties reported.


Total Events: 7

Infrastructure:
1. Russian Missile Attack Damages Regional Water Infrastructure - British intelligence believes that Russia's heavy use of indirect artillery to support the capture of Bakhmut and surrounding territory has likely inflicted collateral damage to the Siversky-Donets canal and other regional water infrastructure, undermining Russia's efforts to remedy the lack of water that its invasion originally created. Russia is likely constructing a water pipeline to mitigate the water shortage in Donetsk City, but this is highly unlikely to fully compensate for the occupied regions' reduced access to water. | Source(s): Censor.net|British analysts

Summary:

On May 16, 2023, a tactical event report from Sevastopol reported one event related to military activity. The report stated that Bellingcat's investigation revealed evidence of Russian grain smuggling through the Avlita terminal in Sevastopol. The Russian military is reportedly stealing Ukrainian grain from occupied farmland, loading it into trucks, and transporting it to Russia or Crimea. In Crimea, the grain is mixed with Russian grain and given a fake export certificate. The grain is then transported on ""ghost ships"" that transfer their cargoes to other ships while at sea. The ultimate destination of the ships is unclear, and many ports refuse to dock Crimean ships carrying grain. The sources for this information include KyivPost, Bellingcat, and BBC.

Tactical Event Report

Summary:

In the temporarily occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian occupiers are threatening to cut off the electricity supply to the homes of residents who do not have Russian passports and are intensifying inspections of cars with Ukrainian license plates. They are detaining such cars at roadblocks and persistently 'persuading' their owners to register their vehicles with the Russian authorities. The occupiers are threatening confiscation if no action is taken and vehicles remain with Ukrainian license plates. This puts infrastructure such as power grids, electrical systems, roads, and transportation systems at risk of damage or disruption, and civilians at risk of losing access to basic necessities such as heating, lighting, and their vehicles.

British intelligence believes that Russia's heavy use of indirect artillery to support the capture of Bakhmut and surrounding territory has likely inflicted collateral damage to the Siversky-Donets canal and other regional water infrastructure, undermining Russia's efforts to remedy the lack of water that its invasion originally created. Russia is likely constructing a water pipeline to mitigate the water shortage in Donetsk City, but this is highly unlikely to fully compensate for the occupied regions' reduced access to water.

The missile strikes by the Russian aggressor on May 8-9 did not cause any harm to Ukraine's power plants and transmission networks, however, the networks of six regional energy companies were damaged. More than 1,200 consumers in Chernihiv region remain disconnected from power supply as a result of shelling attacks.

3. Impact Assessment:
The situation in Kherson, Ukraine is dire. Russian troops are attacking the region frequently, causing significant damage to infrastructure and putting civilians at risk. The water supply system has been damaged, causing possible interruptions in water supply. The discovery of caches of weapons and ammunition during the curfew indicates that there are individuals in the area who are actively working against the Ukrainian government. The reduction of the curfew on May 16 may provide some relief for civilians, but the continued elimination of Ukrainian planes and helicopters by the Russian army suggests that the conflict is far from over. The destruction of Gymnasium No. 20, a historic school, is a tragic loss for the community. The situation in Kherson is unstable and dangerous, and it is unclear when the conflict will end.","[' Civillian Impact', ' Infrastructure Impact']","Russian troops attacked the Kherson region 63 times, firing 354 projectiles, targeting residential areas across the Kherson region's settlements.

3. Impact Assessment:
The situation in Donetsk, Russia remains tense and volatile, with continued Russian aggression and attacks on Ukrainian forces and civilians. The Security Service of Ukraine's exposure of pro-Russian agitators highlights the ongoing propaganda war being waged in the region. The reported support from President Joe Biden for training Ukrainian pilots on advanced aircraft suggests a continued commitment from the United States to support Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia. However, the continued attacks and concentration of Russian forces in the Bakhmut area suggest that the conflict is far from over and that the situation remains precarious.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Intelligence', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","The Russian Federation has increased the pace of deportations and abductions of the civilian population in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. As a result of Russian aggression, 480 children have been killed, and 967 have been injured. The forcible deportation of children is a well-planned Kremlin policy aimed at aggressive indoctrination, ethnic identification change, and the deprivation of Ukraine of its future generation.

A kindergarten was hit by a projectile, causing it to catch fire, and there is also an injured woman with an arm wound. The Legion ""Freedom of Russia"" and ""RVC"" announced the release of Kozinka in the Belgorod region. A group of saboteurs of 80 people in two tanks and two armored personnel carriers is located near the Belgorod village of Kozinka. Russian ""volunteers"" also crossed into the Belgorod region from the side of Ukraine. Special measures and restrictions were established in the region, ranging from checking the documents of individuals and ending with the suspension of the activities of hazardous industries and organizations that use explosive, radioactive, chemically and biologically hazardous substances. The authorities organized the evacuation of residents from the Graivoron district. On May 23, unidentified drones attacked FSB and MIA buildings, causing Russian Security Agencies to lose control over part of the region.

1,"Donetsk, Russia 2023-05-01 - 2023-05-31","1. Executive Summary:
The month of May 2023 in Donetsk, Russia was marked by continued conflict between Ukrainian and Russian military forces, with ongoing attacks on civilians. Russian forces cut off supply lines to Ukrainian forces in Artyomovsk-Bakhmut, conducted drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, and concentrated most of their available reserves to the Bakhmut area. The Security Service of Ukraine exposed pro-Russian agitators spreading anti-Ukrainian content on social media. President Joe Biden reportedly informed G7 leaders that Washington will support a joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots on advanced aircraft. The situation remains tense and volatile, with continued Russian aggression and attacks on Ukrainian forces and civilians.

2. Summary of Significant Events:
During the week of 2023-05-28 to 2023-06-03 in Donetsk, Russia, there were 23 tactical events reported. Military events included the Ukrainian military repelling enemy attacks, the Russian military conducting airstrikes and shelling, and the Wagner Group announcing their withdrawal from the frontline. Infrastructure events included damage to residential houses and other civil infrastructure, and multiple strikes targeting humanitarian convoys. Civilian events included the death of a Ukrainian soldier and the injury of a civilian due to shelling.

On May 21, Russian forces conducted drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, including in the Donetsk region. Two civilians were killed and two more injured in Russia's shelling of the Donetsk region on May 22. Russian forces concentrated most of their available reserves to the Bakhmut area and slowed Ukrainian counterattacks on May 22. The Security Service of Ukraine exposed 12 pro-Russian agitators in different regions of Ukraine on May 23, believed to have been spreading anti-Ukrainian content on social media. President Joe Biden reportedly informed G7 leaders that Washington will support a joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots on advanced aircraft on May 23.

Russian forces cut off supply lines to Ukrainian forces in Artyomovsk-Bakhmut in the Donetsk region on May 24, with a blast to the bridge as they continue the path of complete decimation of Ukrainian forces. Russian forces launched drone attacks on Pokrovsk, shelled the Kurakhove community seven times, and opened fire on Ukrainsk with the Smerch multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) on May 25. Russian troops are making attempts to establish control over Avdiivka and Marinka on May 25. Russian forces conducted another series of drone and missile strikes across Ukraine on the night of May 26. The situation is critical in Bakhmut, Donetsk region, as the Ukrainian military units are holding their defense lines in the Litak district on May 26. An explosion occurred near the so-called Nevsky housing complex, which had recently been built by Russian occupiers on May 27.

3. Impact Assessment:
The situation in Donetsk, Russia remains tense and volatile, with continued Russian aggression and attacks on Ukrainian forces and civilians. The Security Service of Ukraine's exposure of pro-Russian agitators highlights the ongoing propaganda war being waged in the region. The reported support from President Joe Biden for training Ukrainian pilots on advanced aircraft suggests a continued commitment from the United States to support Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia. However, the continued attacks and concentration of Russian forces in the Bakhmut area suggest that the conflict is far from over and that the situation remains precarious.

4. Emerging Risks:
The continued offensive action by the enemy in the Bakhmut sector and the air raid alert issued by the Regional Military Administration indicate that the situation remains volatile. The high number of children killed and injured due to Russian aggression highlights the devastating impact of the conflict on civilians. The long queues for fuel suggest potential supply chain issues. The concentration of Russian forces in the Bakhmut area may indicate a shift in Russian military strategy towards this region.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Intelligence', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","In the past 24 hours, Russians killed 2 residents of the Donetsk region and wounded 9 others.

British intelligence believes that Russia's heavy use of indirect artillery to support the capture of Bakhmut and surrounding territory has likely inflicted collateral damage to the Siversky-Donets canal and other regional water infrastructure, undermining Russia's efforts to remedy the lack of water that its invasion originally created. Russia is likely constructing a water pipeline to mitigate the water shortage in Donetsk City, but this is highly unlikely to fully compensate for the occupied regions' reduced access to water.

The missile strikes by the Russian aggressor on May 8-9 did not cause any harm to Ukraine's power plants and transmission networks, however, the networks of six regional energy companies were damaged. More than 1,200 consumers in Chernihiv region remain disconnected from power supply as a result of shelling attacks. 

According to British intelligence, water shortages are becoming an increasingly critical problem for the Russian occupiers in the temporarily uncontrolled Donetsk. The Siversky-Donets canal which supplies the region remains largely under Ukrainian control but has been frequently contested along its long route. 

Late at night, two explosions occurred in Kramatorsk - Russian missiles fell on the territory of an industrial enterprise. Fortunately, there were no casualties.

Arman Soldin, a video journalist from the French news agency AFP, was killed in eastern Ukraine due to a missile strike. He became the 11th media person to die while covering the war in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his condolences to the journalist's relatives.

Law enforcement officers found 385 bodies in the territories liberated from Russian troops in Donetsk region, and 282 people have been identified. Among the victims of the Russian aggression are 174 men, 117 women, and six children, the gender of 12 more people has not been established. The work to identify the dead continues.

Russians continue to shell the energy infrastructure, leaving some consumers in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Chernihiv regions without power. Despite the difficult security situation, power engineers continue to restore power supply. Over the past day, they managed to restore electricity to 8,000 consumers in Ukraine. Most of them are customers in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions.

Russians placed civilians in terrible living conditions, in rooms without windows, electricity, warm water, and furniture. Also, the invaders forbade the ""evacuated"" citizens to return to Tokmak for an indefinite period. Russian troops continue to suffer heavy losses on the battlefield. As a result, the aggressor equips civilian educational institutions of the temporarily captured territories as healthcare institutions. In Luhansk, the premises of three local hospitals are fully equipped by the Russians as military hospitals for the wounded of light and moderate severity. Russian invaders, under the pretext of evacuating civilians, continue to take looted property out of the front-line settlements of Zaporizhzhia region. In Enerhodar, Russian servicemen completely looted all the town's healthcare institutions.

Ukrainian defenders have used aerial reconnaissance to destroy an electronic warfare system of the Russian troops in the Donetsk region. Using a drone, Ukrainian border guards detected the positions and location of the EW system and the movement of the enemy infantry and then transmitted the coordinates online to an artillery unit of a Ukrainian Armed Forces brigade. Several invaders were also killed in the strike.

Russian missile fragments hit a four-story building in Dnipro, injuring a woman. The power system has suffered unprecedented damage. A lot of resources and time are still needed to restore the level of reliability that existed before Russian massive shelling.

6,"Kyiv, Ukraine 2023-05-01 - 2023-05-31","1. Executive Summary:
During the month of May 2023, Kyiv, Ukraine experienced a series of tactical events related to the ongoing conflict with Russia. The Ukrainian Armed Forces successfully intercepted and destroyed enemy drones, but the threat remains. The vulnerability of the Ukrainian air defense system has been exposed by recent successful Russian attacks, despite Western aid and the delivery of weapons. The US officials' support for training Ukrainians to fly F-16s may provide Kyiv with a new defense capability. However, ongoing Russian attacks on civilians are causing significant destruction and casualties in the city. The situation in Kyiv remains tense and unstable.

2. Summary of Significant Events:
On May 8, Kyiv experienced five tactical events, including air defenses engaging targets over the city, Iranian drones being shot down, causing blasts and debris to fall in two places, and five civilians being injured due to drone wreckage falling in two districts of Kyiv. On May 9, the Ukrainian air defense eliminated about 15 enemy air targets launched by four Russian Tu-95MS bombers from the Caspian Sea region, marking the fifth air attack on Kyiv since the beginning of May. On May 13, Russia launched a wave of kamikaze drones at cities across Ukraine, resulting in three injuries in Mykolaiv and damage to critical infrastructure in the Khmelnytskyi region. However, all drones targeting Kyiv were shot down by the city's air defenses. On May 14, the Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed 25 Russian unmanned aerial vehicles, including 19 combat drones and two Orlan-10 UAVs. The police are still identifying bodies of Ukrainians who died during the occupation of the Kyiv region, with 191 bodies yet to be identified, and 279 considered missing.

3. Impact Assessment:
Kyiv is facing a significant threat from Russia's intensified drone and missile attacks, which are focused on strategic targets in the city and deep rear areas. The vulnerability of the Ukrainian air defense system has been exposed by recent successful Russian attacks, despite Western aid and the delivery of weapons. The US officials' support for training Ukrainians to fly F-16s may provide Kyiv with a new defense capability. However, ongoing Russian attacks on civilians are causing significant destruction and casualties in the city. The situation in Kyiv remains tense and unstable.

4. Emerging Risks:
The use of drones by Russia poses a significant threat to critical infrastructure and civilian populations in Ukraine. The continued engagement of air defenses over Kyiv suggests that the city remains a target for enemy attacks. The identification of bodies and missing persons from the occupation of the Kyiv region highlights the ongoing impact of the conflict on Ukrainian society. The condemnation of foreign leaders' participation in an event in Moscow underscores the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine continues to escalate, with multiple tactical events occurring in Kyiv during the month of May 2023.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","Russian missile and drone strikes have targeted Odesa and Kyiv cities, resulting in the death of more than 20 civilians and injuring more than 50 others. The indiscriminate attacks have caused fear and concern among the local population.

Over the past weeks, the Russian invaders have increased the number of artillery and missile attacks on Ukrainian settlements and civilian infrastructure objects, which are happening almost every day. The attacks have resulted in the death and injury of many civilians, causing fear and concern among the local population.

Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure in Kherson region have caused significant damage to a large supermarket, railway station, and petrol station. The attacks have disrupted the daily lives of the local population and caused significant economic damage.

Two civilians were injured and hospitalized after a building in Kyiv was hit by falling debris from a drone shoot-down. The attack was part of a wave of Russian drone attacks on Kyiv, which caused loud explosions and disrupted above-ground transit until the all-clear was given. 

A building in Kyiv was hit by falling debris from a drone shoot-down, causing heavy damage to two or three apartments. The attack was part of a wave of Russian drone attacks on Kyiv, which also caused loud explosions and disrupted above-ground transit until the all-clear was given. 

Five people were injured when drone wreckage fell onto the Sviatoshynskyi and Solomianskyi districts of Kyiv in the early hours of May 8. Three people were injured at the site of the explosion in the Solomianskyi district, and one in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Two people were later hospitalized in the Sviatoshynskyi district.

The police are gradually identifying the bodies of Ukrainians who died during the occupation of the Kyiv region. As of May 7, 191 bodies have not yet been identified, and 279 are considered missing. Most of the missing people were probably forcibly taken to the territory of the Russian Federation during the occupation. The head of the police department assumed that, based on the testimony of witnesses, people who are considered missing may be in Russian prisons, but there is no confirmed information about them.

As of May 7, there have been civilian casualties in Ukraine due to the ongoing conflict. No specific numbers were provided.

Air defenses in Kyiv are continuing to engage targets over the city. No further details were provided.

At 23:40 on May 7, there was a siren alert in Kyiv. Air defense was shooting Iranian drones Shahed, and there were blasts in Kyiv. Debris fell in two places.

The Ukrainian air defense eliminated about 15 enemy air targets in the sky over Kyiv, which were launched by four Russian Tu-95MS bombers from the Caspian Sea region. This is the fifth air attack on Kyiv since the beginning of May.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine considers the participation of the Prime Minister of Armenia, as well as the Presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the event on the Red Square in Moscow on May 9 as an immoral and unfriendly step towards Ukraine. The ministry stressed that during the event, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin justified killings of Ukrainians, destruction of Ukrainian cities and villages, abduction of Ukrainian children and repressions against residents of occupied Ukrainian territories.

Russia launched a wave of kamikaze drones at cities across Ukraine, injuring three people in Mykolaiv and damaging critical infrastructure in the Khmelnytskyi region. Kyiv was also the target of several drones, but all were shot down by the capital's air defenses, according to authorities. A total of 21 drones were used in the attack, 17 of which were intercepted.

Anti-aircraft defense was working in the Kyiv region due to the threat of enemy UAVs.

Three people were injured in Mykolaiv due to the Russian drone attack.

On the night of May 14, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed 25 enemy unmanned aerial vehicles, including 19 combat drones and two Orlan-10 UAVs. Ukrainian aviation made more than 30 sorties and launched more than 20 airstrikes on the enemy over the past day.

Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine likely with the aim of degrading Ukrainian abilities to conduct counteroffensive operations. Russian forces have conducted at least ten series of strikes throughout Ukraine, particularly in rear areas, since April 19. The new Russian air campaign appears to be focused on Kyiv and alleged Ukrainian military industrial and logistics facilities in deep rear areas.

Kyiv's Court of Appeal upheld the measure of restraint chosen by the former acting commander of one of the units of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Roman Chervinsky. Citizen Chervinsky is suspected of committing a criminal offense under Part 5 of Article 426-1 (Exceeding power or official authority by a military official) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

Recent successful Russian attacks against strategic Ukrainian targets have made clear the vulnerability of the Ukrainian air defense system. Despite Western aid and the incessant delivery of weapons, Kiev seems unable to improve its defense system, continuing to be an easy target for Russia's incisive combat actions.

The administration of President Joe Biden has signaled to European allies in recent weeks that the United States will not stand in the way of their supplying F-16 fighters to Ukraine. U.S. officials will support training Ukrainians to fly F-16s, opening a path for Kyiv to obtain the jets after months of American reluctance.

At 21:40 on May 19, air defense destroyed two enemy UAVs south of Dnipro. According to the Air Force, 16 enemy UAVs and 3 Kalibr cruise missiles were destroyed during the night attack. The KMVA reported that air defense forces destroyed all air targets moving in the direction of Kyiv. Also in the morning of May 19, between 4 and 5 o'clock, the enemy attacked Lviv region with ""Shaheds"". Later it became known that 5 ""Shaheds"" were destroyed in the Lviv region, no casualties or damage were reported.

Russian attacks relentlessly target civilians every day and night, causing significant destruction of civilian buildings and casualties in the city.

The Eastern Bank in Kyiv was destroyed, causing significant damage to local infrastructure.","['KyivPost', 'OHCHR|United Nations Ukraine', 'Twitter (@yorukhunnn)', 'Twitter, UkrainejaneLy, @Ukrainejanel|Twitter, OlegNaronin, @NatHills @NamsanLi', '@nytimes', 'Censor.net', 'InterfaxUkraine|@IMatviyishyn on Twitter', 'Twitter, UkrainejaneLy, @Ukrainejanel', 'Ukrinform News|Twitter (@yorukhunnn)', 'Ukrinform News', 'Ukrinform News|Censor.net', 'Twitter (@mridulaghosh)', 'InterfaxUkraine', 'Twitter, @Euan_MacDonald|Twitter, @OKhudetska', 'InterfaxUkraine|Institute for the Study of War (ISW)', 'KyivPost|Censor.net', 'South Front|Financial Times|The Washington Post']",Kyiv,Ukraine,47.8671228,31.0179572,2023-05-20,1,"27a0123a-a325-44a9-8ace-1c5521474278, 27a0123a-a325-44a9-8ace-1c5521474278, 27a0123a-a325-44a9-8ace-1c5521474278, bc51bdae-8fce-4d66-af9b-3eb165b049e1, bc51bdae-8fce-4d66-af9b-3eb165b049e1, 7e4ced1e-c5c1-4273-9d7a-fe7877a465c0, 7e4ced1e-c5c1-4273-9d7a-fe7877a465c0, 7e4ced1e-c5c1-4273-9d7a-fe7877a465c0, 7e4ced1e-c5c1-4273-9d7a-fe7877a465c0, 7e4ced1e-c5c1-4273-9d7a-fe7877a465c0, a3c91215-c940-47e4-bf1d-7237e74e959c, a3c91215-c940-47e4-bf1d-7237e74e959c, 70681732-6040-4540-b046-050433f31b19, 70681732-6040-4540-b046-050433f31b19, 70681732-6040-4540-b046-050433f31b19, fe69d7bf-a468-4c54-a06e-7475183434e3, 37751f86-e0fd-4826-8b09-ce017642dd13, 37751f86-e0fd-4826-8b09-ce017642dd13, 7088b7ee-9a27-4da0-836b-a8e9bf95e0e8, 7088b7ee-9a27-4da0-836b-a8e9bf95e0e8, 7088b7ee-9a27-4da0-836b-a8e9bf95e0e8, 8f77e1ff-ff44-4747-8aab-87933542bf13, 8f77e1ff-ff44-4747-8aab-87933542bf13",a51282ec-172e-4cfe-9cc7-097bc7bf72c4

3. Impact Assessment:
The events reported during the month of May 2023 in Mariupol, Ukraine indicate ongoing instability and potential threats to both civilians and infrastructure in the area. The Russian occupation of Mariupol has resulted in looting, bombing, and forced participation in Russian propaganda. Civilians are resisting the occupation and cutting down Communist symbols, but the high activity of enemy aviation and continued movement of S-300 missiles towards Zaporizhia from Mariupol suggest that the situation remains volatile. The destruction of over 1100 houses has caused a humanitarian disaster, and the Russian army's continued dismantling of the ruins at Azovstal has further damaged the city's infrastructure.

4. Emerging Risks:
The Russian military buildup in the area around Mariupol, including the deployment of additional troops, tanks, and artillery, is a significant emerging risk. The high activity of enemy aviation and continued movement of S-300 missiles towards Zaporizhia from Mariupol also pose a threat. The Russian propaganda efforts and military leadership visits suggest that the Russians are attempting to sow discord among the local population and exert control over the area.

On May 9, 2023, Ukraine experienced several military and infrastructure-related events. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine condemned the participation of foreign leaders in an event on the Red Square in Moscow, citing it as an immoral and unfriendly step towards Ukraine. The Ukrainian air defense eliminated about 15 enemy air targets launched by four Russian Tu-95MS bombers from the Caspian Sea region, marking the fifth air attack on Kyiv since the beginning of May. The city of Mariupol continued to suffer significant damage to its infrastructure due to the ongoing conflict, with the Russian army destroying over 1100 houses and leaving many civilians without shelter. The Ukrainian Armed Forces were reportedly preparing for a counter-attack in the Tavria direction, with successful reconnaissance battles already underway.

3. 2023-05-09 Impact Assessment:
The ongoing conflict in Ukraine continues to cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt the daily lives of civilians. The Russian army's destruction of over 1100 houses in Mariupol has left many without shelter, and the city is facing one of the biggest humanitarian disasters caused by Russia's aggression. The Ukrainian Armed Forces' preparation for a counter-attack in the Tavria direction suggests that the conflict is ongoing and that both sides are actively engaged in military operations. The continued air attacks on Kyiv by Russian bombers also indicate that the situation remains tense. The water shortages in Donetsk add to the growing list of problems faced by civilians in the region.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","The ongoing clashes between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Russian forces have resulted in high civillian casualties in Bakhmut. The Eastern Grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that 166 occupiers were killed and 206 were injured in the town area during the day. The enemy violates all the rules of warfare, uses prohibited weapons, including phosphorus ammunition, and does not have ""shell hunger,"" which was stated by the owner of the PMC Wagner.

The Church of the Annunciation in Bakhmut was destroyed by militants of PMC ""Wagner"" who fired 21 shells from a tank at the church. The church was a significant part of the local infrastructure and its destruction has impacted the local community.

The ongoing clashes between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Russian forces have resulted in damage to roads and buildings in Bakhmut. The AFU repelled Russian attacks on Chasov Yar-Khromovo road, and clashes between the AFU and Russian forces continue near Khromovo, Yubileynaya street, and Chaikovskoho street. The damage to roads and buildings has impacted the local community's ability to move around and access essential services.

Fragments of a Russian missile fell on a four-story building in Dnipro, injuring a 32-year-old woman who was hospitalized. 

A Twitter user shares that her Jewish family had to flee the city of Dnipro to Qazaqstan during the Holocaust to avoid being murdered by Nazis. When they returned home to Dnipro, there was no home left. 

Debris from a downed Russian missile also fell on a four-story residential building in Dnipro, damaging the roof and ceilings of several apartments. 

British intelligence believes that Russia's heavy use of indirect artillery to support the capture of Bakhmut and surrounding territory has likely inflicted collateral damage to the Siversky-Donets canal and other regional water infrastructure, undermining Russia's efforts to remedy the lack of water that its invasion originally created. Russia is likely constructing a water pipeline to mitigate the water shortage in Donetsk City, but this is highly unlikely to fully compensate for the occupied regions' reduced access to water.

The missile strikes by the Russian aggressor on May 8-9 did not cause any harm to Ukraine's power plants and transmission networks, however, the networks of six regional energy companies were damaged. More than 1,200 consumers in Chernihiv region remain disconnected from power supply as a result of shelling attacks. 

According to British intelligence, water shortages are becoming an increasingly critical problem for the Russian occupiers in the temporarily uncontrolled Donetsk. The Siversky-Donets canal which supplies the region remains largely under Ukrainian control but has been frequently contested along its long route. 

Late at night, two explosions occurred in Kramatorsk - Russian missiles fell on the territory of an industrial enterprise. Fortunately, there were no casualties.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces are reportedly preparing for a counter-attack in the Tavria direction, with successful reconnaissance battles already underway. Military expert Roman Svitan has assessed the likelihood of a breakthrough within a month. Intensive counter-battery warfare has been recorded on both banks of the Dnipro River, with the enemy continuing to conduct defensive operations in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson directions and shelling more than 50 settlements.

A Ukrainian serviceman, fighting under the call sign of ""Tourist,"" has posted on social media about his ultimate mission of preparing for a counter-attack. The latest Facebook postings from the 73rd Marine Special Operations Centre show that the centre's fighters are carrying out ultra-complicated missions to fight for the Ukrainian south, particularly on the Dnipro River.

Scouts from the 73rd Naval Special Operations Center discovered and burned to the ground an enemy MT-LB hidden in the bushes in the Tavria direction. Vivid footage of the detection and destruction of the Russian ""motorized vehicle"" in the south was released on May 8 by a serviceman of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, fighting under the call sign of ""Tourist,"" of the 73rd Marine Special Operations Centre.

The Ukrainian air defense eliminated about 15 enemy air targets in the sky over Kyiv, which were launched by four Russian Tu-95MS bombers from the Caspian Sea region. This is the fifth air attack on Kyiv since the beginning of May.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine considers the participation of the Prime Minister of Armenia, as well as the Presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the event on the Red Square in Moscow on May 9 as an immoral and unfriendly step towards Ukraine. The ministry stressed that during the event, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin justified killings of Ukrainians, destruction of Ukrainian cities and villages, abduction of Ukrainian children and repressions against residents of occupied Ukrainian territories.

Civilians in Mariupol continue to suffer from the ongoing conflict. The Russian army has damaged and destroyed thousands of houses, leaving many without shelter. The invaders are pressuring citizens, especially public sector employees, to get Russian passports. Civilians are also facing a shortage of water and other basic necessities.

Since the full-scale invasion began, the Russian army has damaged 2,208 houses in occupied Mariupol, destroyed 50 percent of them, and has already demolished almost 300 houses. They plan to dismantle another 700 houses. This has left many civilians without shelter and has caused significant damage to the city's infrastructure.

The city of Mariupol has suffered significant damage to its infrastructure due to the ongoing conflict. Residential buildings, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and other buildings have been damaged and destroyed. The city was almost 90% destroyed as a result of enemy shelling. This has left many civilians without access to basic necessities and has caused significant disruption to their daily lives.

The invaders have started mobilizing public sector employees in Mariupol. Male public sector employees are being ordered to pass a military medical commission for the purpose of mobilization. This has caused significant disruption to the city's infrastructure and has left many civilians without access to essential services.

The Russian army has been demolishing civilian houses in Mariupol, leaving pits and piles of stones. This has caused significant damage to the city's infrastructure and has left many civilians without shelter.

On May 7, a missile attack destroyed the rented warehouse of the Odesa regional organization of the Red Cross Society of Ukraine, resulting in the complete destruction of hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid and the death of a civilian security guard. 

The missile attack on May 7 that destroyed the Red Cross warehouse also caused significant damage to the infrastructure of the building and surrounding area.

A recreation center in the Odesa region, which reportedly housed foreign mercenaries, was destroyed by an unknown cause, resulting in significant damage to the infrastructure of the building and surrounding area.

The Ukroliyaprom association of fat and vegetable oil industry participants is facing logistics issues due to the inability to ship manufactured products, leading to the need to stop plants. This is due to the problem with quotas and the queue of agricultural products for export by sea, which is causing significant damage to the infrastructure of the industry.","['Twitter @SergiyKyslytsya, @KyivDiary, @NewVoiceUkraine, @OlegNikolenko_, @DefenceU', 'Censor.net', '@Lyla_lilas', 'Twitter @Spriter99880', 'Ukrinform News', '@Inkvisiit (Twitter)|Charter 97 (online publication)', 'Twitter, @ukraine_world|Ukrinform News', 'Twitter, @AnatMokh @jLcsgo_|InterfaxUkraine', 'Twitter (@UN_Agency, @ukraine_ua)', 'Twitter (@ukraine_ua)', 'InterfaxUkraine|@IMatviyishyn on Twitter', 'Twitter, @molfar_global', 'InterfaxUkraine', 'Charter 97 (online publication)', 'InterfaxUkraine|@front_ukrainian', '@Gerashchenko_en|South Front|@front_ukrainian|Censor.net', 'Censor.net|British analysts', 'Twitter, @OlenaHalushka|Twitter, @ukraine_world|Ukrinform News', 'Twitter (@KramarenkoMari3, @KramarenkoMari3)']",All,Ukraine,46.4843023,30.7322878,2023-05-09,3,"b3bb39ce-70f4-43b1-9b9a-b6a8b1e57078, b3bb39ce-70f4-43b1-9b9a-b6a8b1e57078, b3bb39ce-70f4-43b1-9b9a-b6a8b1e57078, 3ee67c1d-ac0e-4d2b-a462-b650bc753637, 3ee67c1d-ac0e-4d2b-a462-b650bc753637, 3ee67c1d-ac0e-4d2b-a462-b650bc753637, 0580d09a-429c-4164-bf04-118f7fdda1c9, 077fa1ec-82ee-4995-8aa9-95c0d0ec7444, 077fa1ec-82ee-4995-8aa9-95c0d0ec7444, 077fa1ec-82ee-4995-8aa9-95c0d0ec7444, 077fa1ec-82ee-4995-8aa9-95c0d0ec7444, 077fa1ec-82ee-4995-8aa9-95c0d0ec7444, 077fa1ec-82ee-4995-8aa9-95c0d0ec7444, 9ad21fc2-d53f-4b43-a690-9c10b9e98c10, 9ad21fc2-d53f-4b43-a690-9c10b9e98c10, 9ad21fc2-d53f-4b43-a690-9c10b9e98c10, a3c91215-c940-47e4-bf1d-7237e74e959c, a3c91215-c940-47e4-bf1d-7237e74e959c, 44e574c7-645b-40dc-8162-ba9f35947871, 44e574c7-645b-40dc-8162-ba9f35947871, 44e574c7-645b-40dc-8162-ba9f35947871, 44e574c7-645b-40dc-8162-ba9f35947871, 44e574c7-645b-40dc-8162-ba9f35947871, b8390db1-1b3a-4d8e-b167-97fa2192947d, b8390db1-1b3a-4d8e-b167-97fa2192947d, b8390db1-1b3a-4d8e-b167-97fa2192947d, b8390db1-1b3a-4d8e-b167-97fa2192947d",c0722d25-30c1-4752-ace5-1cee4ba10bb6

3. 2023-05-10 Impact Assessment:
The situation across Ukraine and Russia on May 10th, 2023, was marked by ongoing conflict and violence. The events of the day highlight the continued fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces, as well as the impact of the conflict on civilians and infrastructure. The discovery of 385 bodies in liberated territories in Donetsk underscores the toll that the conflict has taken on the local population. The planned terrorist attacks in Crimea and the accusations of Ukrainian involvement in previous attacks in Russia suggest that the conflict may continue to escalate and spill over into other areas. The ongoing shelling of energy infrastructure in Donetsk also highlights the potential for long-term damage to the region's infrastructure and economy. Overall, the events of the day suggest that the conflict in Ukraine and Russia is far from over and that the situation remains volatile and unpredictable.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Intelligence', ' Military Operation', ' Infrastructure Impact']","French reporter Arman Soldin was killed on May 9th on the outskirts of Bakhmut, making him the 12th journalist killed in Ukraine since the war started.

3. 2023-05-15 Impact Assessment:
The situation in Ukraine remains tense, with Russia continuing its aggressive actions against Ukraine. The increased pace of deportations and abductions of the civilian population in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine by the Russian Federation is a cause for concern. The destruction of humanitarian supplies and vital medical equipment due to Russian missile strikes on a humanitarian storage warehouse in Odesa and a Ukrainian Red Cross mobile hospital in Mykolaiv is a significant setback for the humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. The explosion in the center of Luhansk, injuring the so-called ""acting head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the ""LPR"" Ihor Kornet, is a reminder of the ongoing conflict in the region. The enemy missile attacks in Druzhba, affecting civilians and destroying private residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, highlight the continued threat to the civilian population in Ukraine.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","The Russian Federation has increased the pace of deportations and abductions of the civilian population in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. As a result of Russian aggression, 480 children have been killed, and 967 have been injured. The forcible deportation of children is a well-planned Kremlin policy aimed at aggressive indoctrination, ethnic identification change, and the deprivation of Ukraine of its future generation.

Seven residents of the Donetsk region were injured, three in Kostiantynivka, three in Kurakhove, and one in Druzhkivka. It is currently impossible to establish the exact number of casualties in Mariupol and Volnovakha.

Over the past month, there has been a significant reduction in volumes of exports moving out of Ukraine's Black Sea ports, due to increasingly challenging dynamics within the Joint Coordination Centre and a related slowdown in operations.

Russian missile strikes on a humanitarian storage warehouse in Odesa and a Ukrainian Red Cross mobile hospital in Mykolaiv resulted in the destruction of humanitarian supplies and vital medical equipment.

A powerful propaganda campaign designed to justify Russian aggression against Ukraine with the need to protect against genocide was launched in the occupied Donbas. The main message of the fake statements is reference to UN data on the alleged systematic destruction of 13 thousand civilians by Ukrainian troops in CADLO. In fact, the reported death toll (13-14 thousand) refers to both civilians and military casualties on both sides.

Russian terrorists attacked Ukraine with Shahed kamikaze drones, and the consequences of the attack are currently being clarified. Over the past day, the enemy launched 11 missile attacks, particularly on the cities of Kharkiv, Kostiantynivka, and the village of Zolochiv. In addition, the enemy launched 41 airstrikes and carried out 74 attacks using multiple rocket launchers on the positions of Ukrainian troops and settlements. Civilians were affected, and private residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure were destroyed and damaged.

The enemy continues to concentrate its main efforts in the Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Marinka sectors, with 46 engagements recorded there in the past 24 hours. Bakhmut and Marinka remain at the epicenter of hostilities. In the Volyn and Polissia sectors, the operational situation has not changed significantly, and no signs of the formation of enemy offensive groups have been detected. In the Sivershchyna and Slobozhanshchyna sectors, the enemy continues to maintain a military presence in the areas bordering Ukraine.

Over the past day, the enemy launched 11 missile attacks, particularly on the cities of Kharkiv, Kostiantynivka, and the village of Zolochiv. In addition, the enemy launched 41 airstrikes and carried out 74 attacks using multiple rocket launchers on the positions of Ukrainian troops and settlements. Civilians were affected, and private residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure were destroyed and damaged.

Civilians in Ivanivka hardly ever dared to walk around the village due to daily shelling and damage to pavements from Russian vehicles, making it impossible to move around. They used to go to each other through the gardens, until the Russians deployed military vehicles there.

Civilians in Ivanivka lived in fear of Russian soldiers who often broke into empty houses, ate not only their field rations but also stole vegetables and butchered pigs from the locals. They took motorcycles and quad bikes from residents and drove them around the village for fun.

On March 22, the Russians hung an announcement on the gates of the locals: ""For your safety, leaving the house and shelters is allowed from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. It is forbidden to gather for more than three persons, to tear this announcement off ... Failure to meet these requirements will be regarded as an act of aggression.""

Houses, the cultural center, the village council building, the store, and the school were all damaged by shelling, marked with ""Z,"" and fences were cut by debris.

The road bridge over the Desna River near Chernihiv was damaged by Russian shelling, with holes in it and many fallen trees around it.

Several burned-out cars were seen at the bus terminus in Ivanivka.

Battered Russian military vehicles and uniforms of the occupiers were seen in Ivanivka.

The Russians often broke into empty houses, ate not only their field rations but also stole vegetables and butchered pigs from the locals. They took motorcycles and quad bikes from residents and drove them around the village for fun.

Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine likely with the aim of degrading Ukrainian abilities to conduct counteroffensive operations. Russian forces have conducted at least ten series of strikes throughout Ukraine, particularly in rear areas, since April 19. The new Russian air campaign appears to be focused on Kyiv and alleged Ukrainian military industrial and logistics facilities in deep rear areas.

Kyiv's Court of Appeal upheld the measure of restraint chosen by the former acting commander of one of the units of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Roman Chervinsky. Citizen Chervinsky is suspected of committing a criminal offense under Part 5 of Article 426-1 (Exceeding power or official authority by a military official) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

An explosion occurred in a beauty salon in the center of Luhansk, resulting in the injury of the so-called ""acting head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the ""LPR"" Ihor Kornet. The explosion is suspected to be caused by an improvised explosive device planted by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Two missile strikes were reported against the former Luhansk Aviation School of Navigators, where the Russian military were stationed. The strikes were reportedly carried out by the Ukrainian Army.

At least two explosions were heard in occupied Luhansk, after which a column of smoke rose over the city. Former ""LNR ambassador"" Rodion Miroshnik announced two missile strikes in the area of the bus station.

Acting Head of the National Police of Ukraine, Ivan Vyhivsky, visited the training ground in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where policemen of the ""Luhansk-1 Hero of Ukraine Serhiy Hubanov"" battalion, as part of the ""Lyut"" assault brigade, undergo training and combat coordination.

Russian shelling in Hulyaipole, Zaporizhzhia region, damaged an administrative institution and a local store. The extent of the damage and any casualties are being clarified.

On May 14, Russian troops shelled the village of Primorske in the Zaporizhzhia region, resulting in casualties and injuries, including a 7-year-old girl.

Ukrainian troops managed to destroy two 2S7 ""Peony"" self-propelled guns of the Russian Armed Forces with a precision strike in the Zaporizhzhia direction. 

The Russian invaders are carrying out forced deportations under the guise of evacuation from territories where they believe hostilities will take place. They are taking away valuable items such as household appliances and stolen cars. 

Approximately 152,000 Russian servicemembers are stationed in occupied Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, according to Ukrainian intelligence.

Recent successful Russian attacks against strategic Ukrainian targets have made clear the vulnerability of the Ukrainian air defense system. Despite Western aid and the incessant delivery of weapons, Kiev seems unable to improve its defense system, continuing to be an easy target for Russia's incisive combat actions.

The administration of President Joe Biden has signaled to European allies in recent weeks that the United States will not stand in the way of their supplying F-16 fighters to Ukraine. U.S. officials will support training Ukrainians to fly F-16s, opening a path for Kyiv to obtain the jets after months of American reluctance.

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine continues to cause significant damage to local infrastructure and civilian casualties. The reinforcement of the Bakhmut sector by Russian military indicates that the conflict is ongoing and may continue to escalate. The exposure of pro-Russian agitators in different regions of Ukraine highlights the ongoing propaganda war in the region. The support of the United States in training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s and other fourth generation aircraft may have an impact on the conflict in the future.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Intelligence', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","Over the past 24 hours, 92 Russian forces were killed and 156 wounded in 17 firefights with Ukrainian defense forces in the Bakhmut area. It is unclear if there were any civillian casualties.

Footage shows that the occupiers have turned the Ukrainian city into complete ruins. The city, which was once one of the most beautiful in the Donbas, has been destroyed by the ongoing conflict.

Over the last four days, Russia has likely redeployed up to several battalions to reinforce the Bakhmut sector, according to a defense intelligence report by the British and Northern Ireland Ministry of Defense. This suggests that the conflict in the area is ongoing and may continue to impact local infrastructure.

In Bakhmut and Kupyansk directions, the occupiers use about 33,000-35,000 shells per day, according to a spokesman for the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This suggests that the ongoing conflict is causing significant damage to local infrastructure.

Russian forces have concentrated most of their available reserves to the Bakhmut area and slowed Ukrainian counterattacks in the past 24 hours. Ukrainian counterattacks near Bakhmut have notably likely eliminated the threat of a Russian encirclement of Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut and forced Russian troops to allocate scarce military resources to defend against a limited and localized offensive effort, as Ukrainian command likely intended.

Russian sources claimed that Russian troops continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove line. Russian forces continued to conduct ground attacks in the Bakhmut area and slightly increased their tempo of ground attacks along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line. Ukrainian officials stated that Russian forces are preparing defenses by flooding fields in Russian occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.

Another culprit ""promoted"" on social media the idea of erecting monuments to Chechen leader and Putin's ally Ramzan Kadyrov in Ukrainian cities. In Dnipropetrovsk region, a former local businessman was exposed for heroizing the notorious Wagner Group and justifying their participation in the storming of Ukrainian towns in the east of Ukraine. He spread destructive ""slogans"" across social media, as well as in communication with his friends. An entire ""cell"" of pro-Russian agitators was neutralized in Donetsk region.

3. 2023-05-25 Impact Assessment:
The events of May 25th, 2023, highlight the ongoing conflict and tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as the internal factionalism within the Ukrainian military. The arrival of Russian armed forces in Belarus and the signing of papers on nuclear weapons storage further exacerbate the situation.

2,"All, Ukraine 2023-05-21 - 2023-05-27","1. Executive Summary:
The week of May 21-27, 2023, was marked by ongoing military conflict and tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The Ukrainian Army lost control of Artemivsk and retreated from Bakhmut as units of the Wagner PMC captured the territory. The offensive of the Vagner PMC units supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces highlights the involvement of Russian forces in the conflict. Infrastructure events in Belgorod, including the launch of rockets and the dropping of explosive devices, demonstrate the potential for further violence and destruction. The Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region and the arrest of men in the Zaporizhzhia region suggest that the conflict is ongoing and that civilians are at risk. The preparation for an offensive operation by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the defensive lines being built by the Russians indicate that the situation is likely to escalate further.

3. Impact Assessment:
The ongoing military conflict and tensions between Ukraine and Russia continue to escalate, with both sides conducting successful strikes and carrying out offensive actions. The involvement of Russian forces in the conflict is evident, with the offensive of the Vagner PMC units supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces. Infrastructure events in Belgorod, including the launch of rockets and the dropping of explosive devices, demonstrate the potential for further violence and destruction. The Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region and the arrest of men in the Zaporizhzhia region suggest that the conflict is ongoing and that civilians are at risk. The preparation for an offensive operation by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the defensive lines being built by the Russians indicate that the situation is likely to escalate further. The ongoing conflict is a cause for concern, with civilians continuing to be affected and infrastructure being damaged or destroyed.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Intelligence', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","The Russian Federation has increased the pace of deportations and abductions of the civilian population in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. As a result of Russian aggression, 480 children have been killed, and 967 have been injured. The forcible deportation of children is a well-planned Kremlin policy aimed at aggressive indoctrination, ethnic identification change, and the deprivation of Ukraine of its future generation.

Seven residents of the Donetsk region were injured, three in Kostiantynivka, three in Kurakhove, and one in Druzhkivka. It is currently impossible to establish the exact number of casualties in Mariupol and Volnovakha.

Over the past month, there has been a significant reduction in volumes of exports moving out of Ukraine's Black Sea ports, due to increasingly challenging dynamics within the Joint Coordination Centre and a related slowdown in operations.

Russian missile strikes on a humanitarian storage warehouse in Odesa and a Ukrainian Red Cross mobile hospital in Mykolaiv resulted in the destruction of humanitarian supplies and vital medical equipment.

A powerful propaganda campaign designed to justify Russian aggression against Ukraine with the need to protect against genocide was launched in the occupied Donbas. The main message of the fake statements is reference to UN data on the alleged systematic destruction of 13 thousand civilians by Ukrainian troops in CADLO.

3,"All, Ukraine 2023-05-28 - 2023-06-03","1. Executive Summary:
The week of 2023-05-28 to 2023-06-03 saw continued conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Russian forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations in several areas, while also shelling and launching airstrikes on settlements in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Civilians continued to be caught in the crossfire, with high casualties reported in Bakhmut. The complete destruction of the city by the invading Russian army has impacted local infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. The situation remains volatile, with reports of explosions and a Russian military vehicle being destroyed at Kherson Airport, as well as a civilian being detained by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy assured the Arab League of Ukraine's desire for peace and facing Russian aggression, while growing factionalism within the Ukrainian military has led to the formation of serious military opposition to Zelensky and his henchmen. Belarusian President Lukashenka expressed fear of a 'Belgorod Scenario', and Russian armed forces arrived in Belarus, with Defense Ministers of Belarus and Russia signing papers on procedures for keeping Russian ""non-strategic nuclear weapons"" in a special storage facility on the territory of Belarus.

3. Impact Assessment:
The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia continues to escalate, with intense fighting and destruction in multiple regions. Civilians are being killed and displaced, and infrastructure is being damaged. The complete destruction of Bakhmut by the invading Russian army has impacted local infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. The situation remains volatile, with reports of explosions and a Russian military vehicle being destroyed at Kherson Airport, as well as a civilian being detained by Russian forces in Kherson. The growing factionalism within the Ukrainian military has led to the formation of serious military opposition to Zelensky and his henchmen. The arrival of Russian armed forces in Belarus, with Defense Ministers of Belarus and Russia signing papers on procedures for keeping Russian ""non-strategic nuclear weapons"" in a special storage facility on the territory of Belarus, adds to the complexity of the situation.

0,"All, Ukraine 2023-05-01 - 2023-05-31","1. Executive Summary:
The month of May 2023 was marked by ongoing military conflict and tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The Russian army launched multiple attacks on Ukraine, resulting in damage to civilian infrastructure and injuries to civilians. The use of phosphorus munitions by Russian soldiers against Ukrainians caused further concern. The Ukrainian Army lost control of Artemivsk and retreated from Bakhmut as units of the Wagner PMC captured the territory. The offensive of the Vagner PMC units supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces highlights the involvement of Russian forces in the conflict. Infrastructure events in Belgorod, including the launch of rockets and the dropping of explosive devices, demonstrate the potential for further violence and destruction. The situation remains unstable and unpredictable, with civilians and infrastructure at risk of further harm.

2. Summary of Significant Events:
The week of May 7-13, 2023, was marked by continued conflict and violence between Ukraine and Russia. The Russian army launched multiple attacks on Ukraine, resulting in damage to civilian infrastructure and injuries to civilians. Ukrainian defenders continued to fight back, with the 10th separate mountain assault brigade ""Edelweiss"" destroying enemy forces in Bakhmut. The use of phosphorus munitions by Russian soldiers against Ukrainians caused further concern. The killing of six officers of the state emergency service by Russian terrorists was a tragic reminder of the dangers faced by those working to clear the land of mines and bombs. The situation remains unstable and unpredictable, with civilians and infrastructure at risk of further harm.

From May 21-27, 2023, the Ukrainian Army lost control of Artemivsk and retreated from Bakhmut as units of the Wagner PMC captured the territory. The offensive of the Vagner PMC units supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces highlights the involvement of Russian forces in the conflict. Infrastructure events in Belgorod, including the launch of rockets and the dropping of explosive devices, demonstrate the potential for further violence and destruction. The Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region and the arrest of men in the Zaporizhzhia region suggest that the conflict is ongoing and that civilians are at risk. The preparation for an offensive operation by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the defensive lines being built by the Russians indicate that the situation is likely to escalate further.

3. Impact Assessment:
The ongoing conflict in Ukraine continues to cause significant damage to infrastructure and disrupt the daily lives of civilians. The Ukrainian Armed Forces' preparation for a counter-attack in the Tavria direction suggests that the conflict is ongoing and that both sides are actively engaged in military operations. The continued air attacks on Kyiv by Russian bombers also indicate that the situation remains tense. The destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and military capabilities, as well as reports of civilian casualties, highlight the toll that the conflict is taking on civilians and the region as a whole. The loss of control of Artemivsk and Bakhmut by the Ukrainian Army and the involvement of Russian forces in the conflict further exacerbate the situation.

4. Emerging Risks:
The involvement of Russian forces in the conflict and their support of the Wagner PMC units pose a significant risk to the stability of the region. The continued use of phosphorus munitions by Russian soldiers against Ukrainians and the shelling of civilian areas demonstrate a disregard for international law and human rights. The preparation for an offensive operation by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the defensive lines being built by the Russians indicate that the situation is likely to escalate further, with the potential for further damage to infrastructure and harm to civilians.","[' Military Losses', ' Civillian Impact', ' Military Intelligence', ' Military Casualty', ' Military Operation', ' Military Leadership', ' Infrastructure Impact']","Two Canadian citizens, Cole Zelenco and Kyle Porter, were killed in Bakhmut.
